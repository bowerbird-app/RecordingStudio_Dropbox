# Testing Guidelines

- Use Minitest for gem and dummy-app coverage.
- Prefer focused regression tests for hooks, generators, Recording Studio integration points, and dummy host wiring.
- Run `bundle exec rake test` from the repository root for standard validation.
- If a change affects dummy app boot, assets, or migrations, also validate the dummy app path the same way CI does.
- Keep tests deterministic and fix production code rather than weakening assertions to make tests pass.
